### Sample Node Empire Edges Generation

# We will need flow edges for:
#
# Source -> Production Nodes
#  - supply set to # production nodes to ensure all production node flows are enabled.
#  - capacity of 1 since each production node can only supply 1 city.
#  - cost of 0 since these are virtual nodes used for just for flow.
#  - value of 0 since only city supply value nodes have value.
#  - MILP constraint that âˆ‘ of enabled `source_prod_{}` edges = num_production_nodes ensuring supply.
#
# Production Node -> City Supply Value Node
#  - capacity of 1 since only one city can be supplied by a production node.
#  - cost of 0 since these are virtual nodes used for flow selection based on maximizing value.
#  - value of 0 since we store the value on the City Supply Node's outgoing edge.
#
# City Supply Value Node -> Active Production Nodes
# City Supply Value Node -> Unused Production Nodes
#  - capacity of 1 since supply either goes to 1 city or is unused.
#  - cost is > 0 for active production nodes and 0 for unused production nodes.
#  - value is >= 0 the value of the supply to each city with 0 meaning supply cant reach the city
#    because of logistical constraints or is unused.
#  - MILP constraint that a single Production Node only enables one of its outgoing edges.
#
# Active Production Nodes -> Transit Nodes (entry into the interconnected transit node network)
#  - capacity of 1 since each production node enters transit on its own edge.
#  - cost is > 0 since each production node's transit entry incurs a cost.
#  - value of 0 since only city supply value nodes have value.
#  - MILP constraint should not be needed because of the previous Active Production Nodes constraint.
#
# <-> Transit Interconnect Nodes
#  - capacity equal to the number of production nodes so all supplies can move accross all flows.
#  - cost is >= 0 since each transit node incurs a cost except transit across a city.
#  - edge cost is dependent on the destination node since it is assumed the source node's cost has
#    already been counted on the flow leading to it.
#  - edge cost is counted only once and once counted it is freely usable for any other transit.
#    If both edges in the following example are used there should be a single cost of 2:
#      Edge(active_prod_131 -> transit_21, cap: 1, cost: 2, value: 0)
#      Edge(active_prod_132 -> transit_21, cap: 1, cost: 2, value: 0)

# Transit Interconnect Nodes for Cities -> City Warehouse Workers
#  - each city has a distinct capacity of workers and rather than a single node with a single
#    capacity and some variable for determining how much capacity has been used between the transit
#    and the warehouse we instead are using one node per warehouse worker for simple summation.
#  - cost of 0 since these are virtual nodes used for just for flow.
#  - value of 0 since only city supply value nodes have value.

# City Warehouse Workers -> City Warehouse
#  - capacity of the city warehouse's maximum worker limit.
#  - cost of 0 since these are virtual nodes used for just for flow.
#  - value of 0 since only city supply value nodes have value.

# City Warehouse -> Sink
# Unused Production Nodes -> Unused Production Nodes Aggregator
#  - capacity of 1 since each unused production node can only be either active or unused once.
#  - cost of 0 since these are virtual nodes used for just for flow.
#  - value of 0 since only city supply value nodes have value.

# Unused Production Node Aggregator -> Sink
#  - capacity of num_production_nodes
#  - cost of 0 since these are virtual nodes used for just for flow.
#  - value of 0 since only city supply value nodes have value.

# Sink with demand set to # production nodes.
#  - Flow should be conserved from source to sink.

# The goal will be to conserve the flow from source to sink and maximize the value of production
# node supplies reaching the warehouses with a hard limit on the upper bounds of total cost.
